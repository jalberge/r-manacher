# manacher

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

My own try to implement Manacher's algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring. Also works for DNA sequences (with the convention that a DNA palindrome cannot have a single central nucleotide). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of manacher from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jalberge/r-manacher")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(manacher)
## basic example code
manacher("kayak!")
manacher_dna("CGGG", dna=TRUE)
```
