My own try to implement Manacher's algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring. Also works for DNA sequences (with the convention that a DNA palindrome cannot have a single central nucleotide). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of manacher from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jalberge/r-manacher")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(manacher)
## basic example code
manacher("kayak!")
manacher_dna("CGGG", dna=TRUE)
```

### Random sequences of DNA

```{r dna}
nuc <- sapply(1:1000, \(x) manacher_dna(paste0(sample(c("A", "C", "G", "T"), 50, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.59, 0.41, 0.41, 0.59)), collapse = ""))) |> t() |> as.data.frame()
hist(as.numeric(nuc[,"length"]))
```
