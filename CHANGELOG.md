# Changelog

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-03-26

### Added 

- Option to return the longest palindrome overlapping with a certain position (sub-optimal but convenient)

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-03-25

### Added

- An implementation of the Manacher's algorithm to find the longest palindrome in a string in O(N).
- An adaptation of the algorithm to deal with DNA sequences of A, C, G, T and reverse complements instead of strict palindromes. By convention, DNA matches are of even length.
